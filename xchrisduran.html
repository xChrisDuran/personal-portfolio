        <h4><p>Unique in our own ideals and forms of independence, we find ways to share common ground through acts of kindness. The beauty in being human is that we work together to build relationships and share memories. Despite our differences, we live for a common goal- HAPPINESS. There will always be differences in opinion, but taking the time to be kind and understand our differences allows for us to come together. Remember to take the time to listen. Learn to understand why opposite opinions stand their ground and you may find a way to meet in the middle, make life long friends, and life long partners.</p></h4>
